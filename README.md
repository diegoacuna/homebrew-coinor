# Homebrew-CoinOR

A [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) repository for [Coin-OR](http://www.coin-or.org) projects.

This repository hosts formulae for Coin-OR projects that conflict with one another or otherwise don't quite fit in [Homebrew/Science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science).

## How do I install these formulae?

Just

    brew tap dpo/coinor
    brew install <formula>

Enjoy!
